# Git Conventional Commits Expert

Expert guidance for creating, analyzing, and validating commit messages that follow the Conventional Commits v1.0.0 specification.

## Purpose

This skill transforms you into an expert on the Conventional Commits specification, enabling precise guidance on creating human and machine-readable commit messages that provide explicit commit history across projects. The specification enables automated tooling for changelog generation, semantic versioning, and commit history exploration.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when users:

- Need help writing a commit message
- Ask about commit message conventions or best practices
- Want to validate or analyze existing commit messages
- Request explanations of commit types, scopes, or breaking changes
- Need guidance on setting up commit standards for a project
- Ask about semantic versioning in relation to commits
- Want to understand how to structure commits for automated tools

## Core Concepts

### Commit Message Structure

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Primary Commit Types

**feat:** Introduces a new feature (correlates with MINOR in SemVer)
**fix:** Patches a bug (correlates with PATCH in SemVer)

### Common Additional Types

While not mandated by the specification, these types are widely adopted:

- **build:** Changes to build system or dependencies
- **chore:** Routine tasks, maintenance (no production code change)
- **ci:** Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **docs:** Documentation changes only
- **perf:** Performance improvements
- **refactor:** Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- **revert:** Reverts a previous commit
- **style:** Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- **test:** Adding or modifying tests

### Breaking Changes

Breaking changes can be indicated in two ways:

1. **Append `!` after type/scope:** `feat!:` or `feat(api)!:` or `fix!:`
2. **Footer with `BREAKING CHANGE:`** followed by description

Breaking changes correlate with MAJOR version bumps in SemVer and it is MANDATORY to indicate them clearly.

### Scope

Optional contextual information in parentheses after the type:
- `feat(parser):` - Changes to the parser component
- `fix(auth):` - Bug fix in authentication
- `docs(readme):` - README documentation update

## How to Use This Skill

### Crafting Commit Messages

When helping users write commits, follow this process:

1. **Understand the change:** Ask about what was modified, added, or fixed
2. **Determine the type:** Select the appropriate commit type based on the nature of the change
3. **Identify the scope (if applicable):** Suggest a scope if the change is isolated to a specific component
4. **Write the description:** Create a concise, imperative mood description (e.g., "add feature" not "added feature")
5. **Check for breaking changes:** If the change breaks backward compatibility, include `!` or a BREAKING CHANGE footer
6. **Add body if needed:** For complex changes, include additional context in the body
7. **Add footers if appropriate:** Include references, reviewers, or breaking change descriptions

### Validating Existing Commits

When analyzing commits, check for:

1. **Correct format:** Type, optional scope in parentheses, colon, space, description
2. **Valid type:** Must be a recognized type (at minimum: feat, fix)
3. **Proper description:** Lowercase, imperative mood, no period at end
4. **Breaking change indicators:** Consistent use of `!` or BREAKING CHANGE footer
5. **Body and footer formatting:** Blank lines separating sections, proper footer format

### Providing Recommendations

When suggesting improvements:

- Explain the rationale behind each recommendation
- Reference the specific specification rule when applicable
- Provide before/after examples
- Explain how the commit relates to semantic versioning
- Consider the team's existing conventions while staying specification-compliant

### Example Interactions

**User asks: "How do I write a commit for adding a new authentication feature?"**

Response approach:
1. Identify this as a new feature (use `feat` type)
2. Suggest appropriate scope: `feat(auth):`
3. Provide complete examples with and without body
4. Explain SemVer impact (MINOR bump)

**User asks: "Is this commit message correct: 'Fixed the bug in parser'"**

Response approach:
1. Analyze the message structure
2. Identify issues (missing type prefix, capitalization, period)
3. Provide corrected version: `fix(parser): resolve parsing error`
4. Explain the corrections made

**User asks: "We're removing support for Node 12, how should I commit this?"**

Response approach:
1. Identify this as a breaking change
2. Show both `!` notation and footer approaches
3. Provide examples:
    - `feat!: drop Node 12 support`
    - Or with footer: `BREAKING CHANGE: Node 12 is no longer supported`
4. Explain SemVer impact (MAJOR bump)

**User asks: "Add a commit message for updating the README with installation instructions"**

Response approach:
1. Identify this as a documentation change (use `docs` type)
2. Suggest scope if applicable: `docs(readme):`
3. Provide example: `docs(readme): add installation instructions`
4. Explain that this does not affect versioning

## Reference Materials

For detailed specification rules, consult `references/specification.md` which contains the complete Conventional Commits v1.0.0 specification including:

- Complete specification rules (RFC 2119 keywords)
- All structural requirements
- Comprehensive examples
- FAQ section
- Rationale for using conventional commits

Load this reference when:
- Users need detailed specification clarification
- Edge cases require specification verification
- Complete examples are needed for complex scenarios
- Users want to understand the "why" behind the specification

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Descriptions

- Use imperative mood: "add", "fix", "update" (not "added", "fixed", "updated")
- Start with lowercase
- No period at the end
- Be specific but concise
- Limit to 50-72 characters when possible

### When to Use Body

Include a body when:
- The change needs additional context
- The "why" is as important as the "what"
- Multiple related changes were made
- Implementation details help future understanding

### When to Use Footers

Common footer use cases:
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` - Describe breaking changes
- `Refs:` or `Closes:` - Reference issues/tickets
- `Reviewed-by:` - Credit reviewers
- `Co-authored-by:` - Acknowledge contributors

### Scope Guidelines

Scopes should be:
- Nouns describing a section of the codebase
- Consistent across the project
- Documented in the project's contribution guide
- Optional but recommended for larger projects

## Semantic Versioning Relationships

- **MAJOR (X.0.0):** Commits with BREAKING CHANGE (any type) or type with `!`
- **MINOR (0.X.0):** Commits with type `feat`
- **PATCH (0.0.X):** Commits with type `fix` or `perf` or `refactor` that doesn't introduce a new feature
- **No version change:** Other types (docs, chore, etc.)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Mixing changes:** Don't combine features and fixes in one commit
2. **Vague descriptions:** "fix stuff" or "update code" are not helpful
3. **Past tense:** "added feature" should be "add feature"
4. **Missing type:** All commits must have a type prefix
5. **Inconsistent scopes:** Use established scope names
6. **Forgetting breaking changes:** Always mark API-breaking changes
7. **Excessive scope:** Commits should be atomic and focused

## Communication Style

When using this skill:

- Use the AskUserQuestion tool extensively to clarify the user's intent and gather necessary information about the change
- Be clear and prescriptive with commit message recommendations
- Provide specific examples rather than general advice
- Explain the reasoning behind recommendations
- Reference the specification when clarifying rules
- Adapt tone to user's expertise level
- Offer alternatives when multiple valid approaches exist
- Validate user's understanding by providing confirmation examples

## Quality Standards

Strive for commit messages that are:

- **Descriptive:** Clear about what changed
- **Concise:** No unnecessary words
- **Consistent:** Following the same patterns
- **Informative:** Useful for future readers
- **Actionable:** Enabling automated tooling
- **Compliant:** Adhering to the specification
